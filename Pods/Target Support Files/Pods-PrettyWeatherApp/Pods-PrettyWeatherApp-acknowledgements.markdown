\f0\b\fs24 \cf2 **David Casserly / DevedUp Ltd Source Code License**\
\
Last updated: 12th June 2013\
\
Firstly, thanks to Matt Gemmel for producing this file.\
\
Thanks for downloading some of our source code!\
\
This is the license agreement for the source code which this document accompanies (don\'92t worry: you\'92re allowed to use it in your own products, commercial or otherwise).\
\
The full license text is further down this page, and you should only use the source code if you agree to the terms in that text. For convenience, though, we\'92ve put together a human-readable **non-authoritative** interpretation of the license which will hopefully answer any questions you have.\
\
<span style="color:green">Green</span> text shows <span style="color:green">what you can do with the code</span>.\
\
<span style="color:red">Red</span> text means <span style="color:red">restrictions you must abide by</span>.\
\
Basically, the license says that:\
\
1. You can <span style="color:green">use the code in your own products, including commercial and/or closed-source products</span>.\
2. You can <span style="color:green">modify the code</span> as you wish, and <span style="color:green">use the modified code in your products</span>.\
3. You can <span style="color:green">redistribute the original, unmodified code</span>, but you <span style="color:red">have to include the full license text below</span>.\
4. You can <span style="color:green">redistribute the modified code</span> as you wish (<span style="color:red">without the full license text below**).\
5. In all cases, you <span style="color:red">must include a credit mentioning David Casserly</span> as the original author of the source.\
6. David Casserly is not liable for anything you do with the code, no matter what. So be sensible.\
7. You <span style="color:red">can\'92t use the name David Casserly, the name DevedUp Ltd, the DevedUp Ltd logo or any other related marks to promote your products</span> based on the code.\
8. If you agree to all of that, go ahead and use the source. Otherwise, don\'92t!\
\
**Suggested Attribution Format**\
\
The license requires that you give credit to David Casserly, as the original author of any of our source that you use. The placement and format of the credit is up to you, but we prefer the credit to be in the software\'92s \'93About\'94 window. Alternatively, you could put the credit in a list of acknowledgements within the software, in the software\'92s documentation, or on the web page for the software. The suggested format for the attribution is:\
\
**Includes &lt;Name of Code&gt; code by **[**David Casserly**](http://www.devedup.com)**, DevedUp Ltd.**\
\
where &lt;Name of Code&gt; would be replaced by the name of the specific source-code package you made use of. Where possible, please link the text \'93David Casserly\'94 to the following URL, or include the URL as plain text: [http://www.devedup.com](http://mattgemmell.com/)\
\
**Full Source Code License Text**\
\
Below you can find the actual text of the license agreement.\
